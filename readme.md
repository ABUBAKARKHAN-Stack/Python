# 🐍 Python Learning Journey  

Welcome to my **Python Learning Repository**!  
This repo documents my hands-on journey of learning Python step by step.  
Instead of just theory, I’m building **mini-projects** for each topic to understand the concepts better.  

---

## 📚 Topics Covered So Far  

### 1️⃣ Strings (Immutable Datatype)  
- Learned about string properties and methods.  
- **Key methods:** `lower()`, `upper()`, `find()`, `replace()`, `split()`, `join()`, `strip()`, `len()`.  
- Practiced indexing, slicing, and transformations.  

---

### 2️⃣ Mutable Datatypes  
- **Lists** → dynamic arrays with methods like `append()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `insert()`, `sort()`, etc.  
- **Sets** → unordered collections with unique elements. Explored `union()`, `intersection()`, `difference()`.  
- **Dictionaries** → key-value pairs for fast lookups. Learned `get()`, `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `update()`.  

---

### 3️⃣ Conditionals (Decision Making)  
Explored `if`, `elif`, `else`, nested conditionals, ternary operators, and `match-case`.  

#### ✅ Mini Projects Built:
1. **Smart Kettle Notification System** → Alerts when water is ready.  
2. **Snack Suggestion System** → Suggests snacks based on user input.  
3. **Cup Size Price System** → Calculates price based on cup size (small/medium/large).  
4. **Smart Thermostat Alert System** → Checks device status + temperature before giving alerts.  
5. **Delivery Fee Waiver** → Uses ternary operator to decide free delivery.  
6. **Train Seat System** → Uses `match-case` to decide seat category.  

---

### 4️⃣ Loops (Iteration & Flow Control)  
Explored **for-loops**, **while-loops**, **loop controls** (`break`, `continue`), and Python’s unique **for-else** construct.  

#### ✅ What’s inside:
- **for-loop/** → 6 beginner-friendly mini projects using `for` loops.  
- **while-loop/** → 2 practical mini projects using `while` loops.  
- **break-continue/** → Real-world inspired examples showing loop control in action.  
- **for-else/** → Examples + explanation of how `for-else` works in real scenarios.  

Each section is explained with **chai-inspired ☕ real-world examples** + clear code comments, making loops easier and fun to learn.

## 🚀 Goal of This Repo  
- Learn Python from basics to advanced concepts.  
- Reinforce learning with **real-world inspired projects**.  
- Document the entire journey in a structured way.  

---

## 📌 Next Steps (Roadmap)  
- 🛠️ Functions (with parameters, return values, scope)  
- 🎯 OOP (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism)  
- 📦 Modules & Packages  
- ⚡ File Handling & Exceptions  
- 🌐 Advanced Topics (Decorators, Generators, Async, etc.)
