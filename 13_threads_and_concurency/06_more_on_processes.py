üî• Number Crunching Battle ‚Äî Threads vs Processes (CPU-HEAVY TASKS)

We already know the winner üí™ (hint: multiprocessing),
but let's *see it in action* and understand **why** it's always preferred
for CPU-bound tasks.

Remember:
- Threading ‚Üí good for I/O-bound (like API calls, file reads)
- Multiprocessing ‚Üí best for CPU-heavy work (like loops, calculations)

#* Process Queue With Example ‚Äî Passing Data Between Processes

# from multiprocessing import Queue, Process
#
# # Function to prepare chai and send message into queue

#     queue.put("Masala chai is ready! ‚òï")
#
#
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     queue = Queue()

#     # Create a process and pass queue as argument
#     p = Process(target=prepare_chai, args=(queue,))
#
#     p.start()
#     p.join()
#
#     # Retrieve message from queue
#     print(queue.get())

#* Process Value With Example ‚Äî Shared Memory Between Processes
# ------------------------------------

from multiprocessing import Process, Value


# Shared counter increment function
def increment(counter):
    for _ in range(100000):
        # Lock ensures thread-safe (process-safe) increments
        with counter.get_lock():
            counter.value += 1


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Shared integer ('i' = int type, initial value = 0)
    counter = Value("i", 0)

    # Create 4 processes, all incrementing the same shared counter
    processes = [Process(target=increment, args=(counter,)) for _ in range(4)]

    # Start all
    [p.start() for p in processes]

    # Wait for all to complete
    [p.join() for p in processes]

    print(f"‚úÖ Final counter value: {counter.value}")


# ------------------------------------
# Summary:
# - Threads share memory ‚Üí blocked by GIL ‚Üí not ideal for CPU-heavy
# - Processes = true parallel execution ‚Üí faster for number crunching
# - Queue ‚Üí allows communication between processes
# - Value ‚Üí allows sharing variables safely
# TODO: TIP - Uncomment each section one by one to try
