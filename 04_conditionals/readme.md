# Conditionals in Python â€“ Mini Projects

## ðŸ“Œ What is this folder about?
This folder contains Python scripts that demonstrate the use of **conditionals** in Python with practical, real-world inspired mini projects.  

Conditionals allow us to control the flow of a program by executing certain blocks of code only if specific conditions are met.  
In this folder, youâ€™ll see how `if`, `elif`, `else`, `nested if`, ternary operators, and `match-case` work in action.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Each project is short, beginner-friendly, and focused on one concept.  
- Input handling uses `.lower()` to avoid case-sensitive mismatches.  
- This folder is part of my Python learning journey, but it can also serve as a reference for beginners exploring conditionals.
